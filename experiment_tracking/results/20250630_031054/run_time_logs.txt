│  STEP 1 - UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION:                                                                          │
│  - What specific metric is being asked for?                                                                 │
│  - What time periods are involved?                                                                          │
│  - Are there conversational references to resolve?                                                          │
│  - What type of calculation is needed (lookup, change, ratio, percentage)?                                  │
│                                                                                                             │
│  STEP 2 - RESOLVE CONVERSATIONAL CONTEXT:                                                                   │
│  - If question contains "that", "it", "this value" → use the most recent result from conversation history   │
│  - Example: Previous answer was 78.93, question asks "what is that divided by 100?" → use 78.93             │
│  - "the previous year" → identify specific year from context                                                │
│  - "the difference between the two values" → use the two most recently mentioned values                     │
│                                                                                                             │
│  STEP 3 - DATA EXTRACTION:                                                                                  │
│  - Scan the ENTIRE table systematically (all rows, all columns)                                             │
│  - Look for EXACT metric name matches first, then synonyms                                                  │
│  - When you see years (2012, 2014), distinguish:                                                            │
│    * Column headers (time periods) vs actual numeric values                                                 │
│    * Don't confuse year labels with the data values                                                         │
│  - For ambiguous cases, choose the value that makes business sense for the question                         │
│                                                                                                             │
│  STEP 4 - CALCULATION:                                                                                      │
│  - Percentage change: (new - old) / old                                                                     │
│  - Differences: pay attention to order ("change from A to B" = B - A)                                       │
│  - Ratios: check question for correct numerator/denominator                                                 │
│  - Preserve negative signs for declines, losses, decreases                                                  │
│                                                                                                             │
│  STEP 5 - VERIFICATION:                                                                                     │
│  - Does the result magnitude make sense?                                                                    │
│  - Are signs correct (positive/negative)?                                                                   │
│  - Is the scale appropriate?                                                                                │
│                                                                                                             │
│  COMMON ERROR PATTERNS TO AVOID:                                                                            │
│  - Don't return years (2012, 2014) when asked for financial values                                          │
│  - Don't lose negative signs in calculations                                                                │
│  - Don't confuse different metrics (net earnings ≠ operating income)                                        │
│  - Don't ignore conversational context ("that" refers to previous result)                                   │
│                                                                                                             │
